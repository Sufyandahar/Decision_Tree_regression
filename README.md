# Decision_Tree_regression
Decision Tree regression implemented in python

Steps i followed:
    Implementing Decision Tree Regression in Python Decision tree algorithm creates a tree like conditional control statements to create its model hence it is named as decision tree.

Decision tree machine learning algorithm can be used to solve both regression and classification problem.

In this post we will be implementing a simple decision tree regression model using python and sklearn.
